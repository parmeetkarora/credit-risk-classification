# credit-risk-classification

Background
In this project, we aim to develop a model that assesses loan risk using a dataset from a peer-to-peer lending services company. By analyzing historical lending activity, we seek to identify the creditworthiness of borrowers, which is essential for lenders to make informed decisions.

The dataset contains various features related to the loans and borrower characteristics, enabling us to build a predictive model. Specifically, this analysis will employ logistic regression to classify loans into two categories: healthy (0) and high-risk (1) based on their likelihood of default.

Through a systematic approach of data preparation, model training, and evaluation, this project will provide insights into the effectiveness of machine learning techniques in predicting loan defaults. The findings aim to support the lending company in mitigating risks associated with credit decisions.

Instructions
The instructions for this Challenge are divided into the following subsections:

Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets

Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data

Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report

Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets
Open the starter code notebook and use it to complete the following steps:

Read the lending_data.csv data from the Resources folder into a Pandas DataFrame.

Create the labels set (y) from the “loan_status” column, and then create the features (X) DataFrame from the remaining columns.

note
A value of 0 in the “loan_status” column means that the loan is healthy. A value of 1 means that the loan has a high risk of defaulting.

Split the data into training and testing datasets by using train_test_split.

Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data
Use your knowledge of logistic regression to complete the following steps:

Fit a logistic regression model by using the training data (X_train and y_train).

Save the predictions for the testing data labels by using the testing feature data (X_test) and the fitted model.

Evaluate the model’s performance by doing the following:

Generate a confusion matrix.

Print the classification report.

Answer the following question: How well does the logistic regression model predict both the 0 (healthy loan) and 1 (high-risk loan) labels?

Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report
Write a brief report that includes a summary and analysis of the performance of the machine learning models that you used in this homework. You should write this report as the README.md file included in your GitHub repository.

Structure your report by using the report template that Starter_Code.zip includes, ensuring that it contains the following:

An overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

The results: Using a bulleted list, describe the accuracy score, the precision score, and recall score of the machine learning model.

A summary: Summarize the results from the machine learning model. Include your justification for recommending the model for use by the company. If you don’t recommend the model, justify your reasoning.
